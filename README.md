# emmas-to-done
This repository stores an app called "To Do...ne!", which - as you may have already guessed - can be used to create and manage todo lists.

The page has a very basic UI and uses no backend services. All To Dos are managed with the help of JS objects, allowing CRUD to be performed directly on the list with the objects that represent ToDos.
